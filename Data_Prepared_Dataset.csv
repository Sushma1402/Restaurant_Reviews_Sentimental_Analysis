Andhra Chilliy Chicken was amazing as always.

Caj√πn Potato Wedges not so much. They are good when crispy. Not so much after.

Parota was too hard by the time it reached and is still not eaten.

First, we asked to taste their beer to which the waiter suggested that he gets all 8 instead of the one we wanted. To our surprise, it was added in the bill.

Well, we liked their Apple Cider and Blonde Ale. We also called for a whiskey sour and it was perfect. We called for Cheesy Gunpowder Pondy Fries. This is a must try folks. Perfect crispy fries with medium spice served with a mango flavoured sauce. Couldn't get enough of it....read more",1

The medium steak - grilled veggies & mash - the creamy spinach sauce - all were individually packed.
Everything came together beautifully!
I would have loved a little bit more sauce/gravy on the steak but I guess this is the actual way to enjoy the flavours as anything else just smothers the original taste....
The deliciously crunchy chewy cookie ended the culinary experience fabulously!

Beers; if you don't like the very bitter ones, go for Tintin toit or toit weiss; if you do then colonial toit and dark knight are good options.
Then there's apple cider which is sweet, but I personally don't like it that much at toit.",1

I had Pesto roasted veg pizza and it was amazing. I also tried Moussaka (went by the fancy name ;) ) and it was ok - I did not quite like the taste of eggplants.

The service was also good. One thing which pestered me was one of the servers coming to check for order again and again, even after several veg/non veg dishes.",1

In the menu you will find their six famous brews that you can try.
Lemon chicken - great appetizer that goes well with drinks 
Drunken Pizza -  now that's something! A thin crust pizza with vodka in it.

Food-
Lemon Chicken- A perfect appetizer with a little tangy taste.
Mac N Cheese balls- Sufficient portion, deep fried balls with red sauce Mac N Cheese filled inside.

They strictly enforce the age rule for alcohol here (which I did not see anywhere else in Pune) i.e. They won't serve you any alcoholic beverage if you are under 21 AND they will serve you ONLY Beer and Wine if you're under 25.

Toit is a treat when it comes to ambience, music, crowd, space ,drinks and food!
Pizza: We ordered half veg and half non veg tray. The spicy chicken was good, for the veg, we ordered awzberg( the one with sundried tomatoes), which was more like Margherita as there were hardly any toppings on it.
For Beer: we ordered TinTin,as I am not a fan of alcohol, beer etc and the fact tgat I drank 100 ml of it is enough to tell the beer is good.

Inspite of the veg pizza, I give them a 4.5 for the ambience, feel and brews.",1

The beers. Do get a tester (Rs. 300) before ordering to decide what you'd like. I'd recommend the Tintin for light beer lovers and Dark Knight for the ones who prefer their beers darker.
The haleem samosa was yummy.

Nays:
The place was so packed that the service suffered. It was very slow. We had to get our own drinks.

I was randomly searching for a new brewery in Pune, and i came across Toit( FYI i was already amazed with the Toit's Outlet in Bangalore). Its worth visiting and their beers are awesome. My favourite is Toit Tintin/Weiss (pls dont spellcheck).

So I naturally went in the week it opened and the beers just tasted wow . The food is okay just like any other pub but the beers were awesome. We tried belgian and irish . Belgian is a bit mild and irish is a bit dark . In food we ordered pizza üçïand fries üçü. Also a huge fan of their Tiramisu . ‚ô•Ô∏è,1

The place was overcrowded when we reached and hence opted to sit at the bar. We got a table after sometime but the bar sitting is equally comfortable. The staff is extremely courteous and friendly.

Located in kalyani nagar, in place of the famous Soho-Toscana, the location and the built up of toit was just mesmerising. The open area was massive alongside the non-smoking covered portion. Since we were a table of 4 we were seated on those high end chairs, which was fine intially but as our orders increased the table got wobbly (alongside us as well :p).

Average food cost is 1500 for 2people with pathetic taste.
Smelly lounge area, miserable ambience post 10 and music has gone for toss post 10, Most miserable part is they have very very humiliating staff

#harryhearsyou | It's always delightful to find restaurants that one's hardly heard of, and their living up to expectations. I've been residing in the #balewadi area for close to 8 years now, and was surprised to have never stumbled upon #eskobar, located in a quaint alley!

This unwind-with-your-mind joint features some amazing appetizers, mocktails and main course dishes.

What will catch you attention instantly is the decor, which blends with the unilight theme that is very prevalent here. Yes, admittedly this is a place where you will need to step in after 8:00 PM to take in the vibe and glide through all that it can offer.

1. They do not have potable drinking water in a restaurant. You have to get a bottle. We asked the for filtered water but they said they do not have a corporation water connection and no filter. So one can only wonder what water they use to cook.

2. The green chutney with the starers was old and smelt really bad. Complained, they took it away, did not replace it.

3. The Dal Malani we ordered was sweet! Not like little sweet. Legit sweet. ?!?

Rest of the food was OK. I liked the Paneer Angara.

Reasons are as below:

1: SERVICE CHARGE COMPULSION- This restaurant forces you to pay the service charge which is 10% of total bill. If you try to tell them about non-compulsion and guidelines as per government, they will bring up some story of some ramdon talks with government policies and of we ask them about it, it's not clear from there side.

2: SERVICE - Provided that they charge SC, the service is very very poor. We have to wait quite alot which is annoying for what we pay.

3: FOOD- Food quality and taste is nice. Quantity is decent enough.

In total the amount of tax we pay over there is close to 20% of total bill which is why I am giving 2 stars.",0

Starting with the ambience it‚Äôs very serene and peaceful. Love the vibe of the place, it‚Äôs done up pretty well. Seems to be an bungalow turned into a cafe. We had made a reservation. Coming to the food part we had ordered for their sample burger which tasted pretty good and their aglio-olio pasta which are pretty different then the ones which we get outside. We liked the taste of it. It‚Äôs a bit spicy. In drinks we tried the Pruveian drink which was refreshing. We also had a dark chocolate cake which they claimed was made fresh.

3287,3287,Cafe Paashh,4.9,Nimish Tandon,5.0,"We went there to celebrate our anniversary. The ambience was amazing. We ordered 4-5 items and all were good. Chian Mai soup was just superb. The menu has selective items but one unique thing about Paashh is that each dish has a unique taste and you can easily feel the difference in taste.

Quality of food was excellent. Definitely recommend for the experience and something hatke",1
3288,3288,Cafe Paashh,4.9,Mandar Khodegaokar,5.0,"Great place! Very soothing and calm. Food is great too. We tried lot of the options: burger sampler is great especially if one like falafel, paani of paani puri is to die for. We kept drinking it till the end of the meal. For main course we had: kothu paratha, thalipith and Mee Goreng: everything was rich with healthy ingredients. Hats off to the chef for the food combination/fusion.

I like the fact they have maintained Marathi origins (which is rare) along with healthy and continental food. Must visit place for everyone. Manager and server were also great. Thank you entire team for the experience.",1

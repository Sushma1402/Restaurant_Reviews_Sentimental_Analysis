This morning we came at 11. It clearly states Breakfast ends at 11 and we ran late so decided we would go for lunch. It took 20min for anyone to acknowledge our presence, never were given water, luckily we ordered drinks.

I ordered Mac and cheese balls, which was creamy from the inside and crispy from the outside.
Toit full house pizza is a lovely change from various farmhouse pizzas served at other places. Not very happy with the crust of it, but the sauce, cheese and veggies were perfect.
Aglio olio pasta was not 100% authentic. These guys add several ingredients other than the main ones, which does amplify the flavor.

Then I failed to understand why carrying water bottle wasn't ok especially in covid when we prefer drinking from our own bottle instead of hotel glasses. Did not understand the logic.

Well, we liked their Apple Cider and Blonde Ale. We also called for a whiskey sour and it was perfect. We called for Cheesy Gunpowder Pondy Fries. This is a must try folks. Perfect crispy fries with medium spice served with a mango flavoured sauce. Couldn't get enough of it....read more"

Everything came together beautifully!
I would have loved a little bit more sauce/gravy on the steak but I guess this is the actual way to enjoy the flavours as anything else just smothers the original taste....

A play on the the marathi word 'koshimbir' which means a chopped salad of cucumber, coriander lemon and coconut, this drink was a gin-ny interpretation of that and we absolutely loved it. We also especially loved their buff kerala fry on parotta. Yum yum yum!

Bhetki fish used for Fish 'n' Chips?!!?? really not the right choice for fish n chips, quite an insult to the original British fish n chips which is usually served with vinegar.. why are we spoiling original dishes with this pathetic fusion i just don't get it."

The reason we went there was the beer(obvio) which was to put it mildly sub par. The 'dry stout' seemed watered down more than anything. The absolute worst bit is the tiny glasses of water and the massive delay in bringing each bottle (of water) to the table. I hope that it isn't a part of the strategy to sell more beer but I feel like serving water a very basic thing that all restaurants need little effort to get right.
The 3*s are simply due to the polite and friendly staff, the pastas that they have and respect to the Banglore location(which is much much better)."

1st things 1st, they don't have beer tasters!! How can a brewery not have beer tasters? You got to pay extra for tasters.

Then, since the place is super new and it was my first visit, i didn't want to experiment much so i called for the safest option that is bbq smoked chicken wings and onion rings for starters. The starters itself took so long that i had made up my mind that i don't want to eat here now.

There may be places which you don‚Äôt like to visit twice, but Toit isn‚Äôt like that. Here you will get delicious food coupled with magnificent environment. You‚Äôll fall in love with the place for its lovely music and the vibes you get.
Some of my personal recommendations to try here are,

Grilled Salmon: This marinated salmon is fresh salmon fillets flavored with garlic and herbs, then grilled to perfection. You‚Äôll want grilled salmon all summer long after you taste this easy marinade! Served with rice and grilled vegetables.

I had Pesto roasted veg pizza and it was amazing. I also tried Moussaka (went by the fancy name ;) ) and it was ok - I did not quite like the taste of eggplants.

Food-
Lemon Chicken- A perfect appetizer with a little tangy taste.
Mac N Cheese balls- Sufficient portion, deep fried balls with red sauce Mac N Cheese filled inside.

BUT

They strictly enforce the age rule for alcohol here (which I did not see anywhere else in Pune) i.e. They won't serve you any alcoholic beverage if you are under 21 AND they will serve you ONLY Beer and Wine if you're under 25. They did not even serve Sangria for a 22 year old! They only serve beers made by them and I did not like a single beer.
So if you're Under 25 and want to drink, give it a skip.

1. Fish Pollichatu was very delicious was cooked and served in Banana leaves..

For Beer: we ordered TinTin,as I am not a fan of alcohol, beer etc and the fact tgat I drank 100 ml of it is enough to tell the beer is good.

Another recommendation would be whisky sour (with egg white) - rich, foamy and heavenly. The best I've had in Pune.

And to be very honest, the service is below average and the food is average.
If this place has to be in business for the long run, it really needs to take care of these two pillars, and when I say service, it includes everything, from the person who picks up the call to the servers, managers and like wise.

When we reached there were hardly few people, many seats were vacant, but they still refused to give us seat to sit. They asked us to hang by the BAR on a standing table for the whole match 3-4 hours.

Also the language was so disrespectful even manager was so rude, it was like we dont need anyone of you as its FIFA FINAL is there even if you leave we will get other customers so we dont give a damn about it.

We were served by SWAPNIL and he was very calm in helping us with the best dishes and drinks they serve.

Some of us who stayed late arguing with the manager eventually found out that they slap random fines on customers because they have to pay off an entire squadron of police which is always waiting at the door, could be because this place does not have the licence to serve alcohol."

While the service and unavailability of most drinks will spoil your night, the pub does have lots of space, decent crowd and decent DJs.
The problem is it's very poorly maintained.

I paid Rs. 5000 as fine. I asked them the reason for the fine but the manager didn‚Äôt like it and he called the bouncers. They will force you to pay whatever they demand. One should not stay here after 12. They will treat you good while serving the food and drinks and after that their behaviour changes completely. I also recorded few videos that shows the waiters and the managers fighting with us for no reason and forcing us to pay the fine.

Do not be fooled by their prices on Zomato It is outdated.

Food wasn't upto the mark, for eg: Honey chilli means it needs to spicy and sweet, but this one was just sweet without any kick to it. Prawns, Chicken spring roll too weren't that great.

Drinks were a bit too expensive. atleast if you're paying 400 for a mocktail it needs to have good quantity, here the mocktail quantity was less than the cocktail quantity.

Overall, it was an okayish experience with everything being a bit on the expensive side."

Average food cost is 1500 for 2people with pathetic taste.
Smelly lounge area, miserable ambience post 10 and music has gone for toss post 10, Most miserable part is they have very very humiliating staff

Service charge was levied in spite of requesting to remove it from the bill. They say they have mentioned it everywhere that they charge SC. However, mentioning that you sell cocaine in the menu doesn't make it legal. But the manager was adamant on charging it anyway.

They first added a cocktail to the bill that was never given to us. This we got corrected. However, on leaving and rechecking the bill we realised they had slyly added another food dish that was never ordered. Just going to put it out there...This restaurant owes me 515+tax.

Starters were served only till 10:30 and DJ was closed at 1, who puts off the DJ at 1 on 31st night. This was the most disappointing stuff. Main course food was also not at all properly organised. I do not want to write the name of the manager who had promised us all this.

Asked for a beer, they got a bottle, I had to ask for a glass, which was given after requesting it. (We were seated at a table).

The cocktails asked, were severely watered down. There was very little trace of alcohol in it. We had to ask the manager to make the drink properly.

Food was ok. Will definitely not go again. There are better restaurants around."

We had couple of chicken starters, crispy corn and some fritters. First, quantity of none was sufficient even for 3 people. Coming to the taste, any saute or tempura type starters like crispy corn or chicken chilly had a either a very bland or otherwise overpowered sauce flavour, which usually people won't like. Only one chicken tandoori starter was well cooked (but yeah, it had small piece servings) So both on the QUALITY & QUANTITY side, starters were a BIG THUMBS DOWN. Adding to starters, their breads (cheese naan) is PATHETIC.

this is absolutely non ethical.. and because of this i we won't recommend anyone ever to visit this restaurant..
absolutely non ethical and the person was arrogant ( Pavan Samuel). He was absolutely disgusting to even talk to.. He went on to say it is his wish what to charge and how much to charge. To remove the service charge he insisted to pay using another payment mode like cash or Credit card."

The staff here feels they doing a favor on us by letting us in and allowing us to sit and spend.. Total waste of money time and experience. Their staff ruined our evening.. Never going back

Munchings we had was decent taste.

Too many tables very close to each other, music was horrible as the DJ was jumping between trance, house and rock and pop music.

We were planning to visit for New Years Eve, and hence asked to book a table on phone. We were informed it's a walk in. After reaching the place, they started demanding exorbitant unjustified cover charge. We were a group of 3, they made us buy a table for four, and asked us to pay cover charge for 4 people, even though we were just three. This was not informed on phone, and was told after traveling 25kms and reaching there.

Will not recommend this place at all"

1. They do not have potable drinking water in a restaurant. You have to get a bottle. We asked the for filtered water but they said they do not have a corporation water connection and no filter. So one can only wonder what water they use to cook.

2. The green chutney with the starers was old and smelt really bad. Complained, they took it away, did not replace it.

3. The Dal Malani we ordered was sweet! Not like little sweet. Legit sweet. ?!?

Rest of the food was OK. I liked the Paneer Angara.
This is one of the best places I heard of in Pune and their prices sure reflect the same, unfortunately their quality does not."

Reasons are as below:

1: SERVICE CHARGE COMPULSION- This restaurant forces you to pay the service charge which is 10% of total bill. If you try to tell them about non-compulsion and guidelines as per government, they will bring up some story of some ramdon talks with government policies and of we ask them about it, it's not clear from there side.

2: SERVICE - Provided that they charge SC, the service is very very poor. We have to wait quite alot which is annoying for what we pay.

3: FOOD- Food quality and taste is nice. Quantity is decent enough.

In total the amount of tax we pay over there is close to 20% of total bill which is why I am giving 2 stars."

Lychee drunk tasted more like a milkshake so a 2.5 stars for that and Mojito was as good as a normal one so may be 4 stars for that.

Important thing was service - waiters never came to serve water or any dish we ordered. Its their job to give us clean table. We had to request three times to get our table cleaned. Yogesh was pathetic waiter who gave us poor service. We kept asking for menu, fork, tissues he was negligent.
